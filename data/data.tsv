cat_graph:knb.5A160445	Method (How)	When you upload your data(set) or metadata to a data repository, the data repository (or other service providers) usually assigns a PID. Repositories ensure that the identifier continues to point to the same data or metadata, according to access terms and conditions you specified. There are many different types of PIDs, each with their own advantages, disadvantages, and disciplines they are typically used in. Generally speaking, the data repository will have thought about these aspects before deciding which PID type to use. In case you have to choose the PID type yourself, you can visit the Knowledge Hub on the PID Forum for guidance. Some disciplines or organisations also provide tools to help you make this choice, see for example this Persistent Identifier Guide for cultural heritage researchers. Once you have chosen a PID type, you can search for data repositories providing that specific PID in registries such as Re3data or FAIRsharing (see related databases) . Not all data you produce during your research will need a PID. In general, those that underpin published findings or have longer term value are worth assigning a PID.

Besides publications or datasets, a PID can also refer to, for example, a person, a scientific sample, a funding body, a set of geographical coordinates, an unpublished report, or a piece of software. Depending on what you find important to link to, you might want to consider using a PID for one or more of these resource types. Persistent identifiers may point to a data file, a web service response that contains data values, or ideally to an online page that contains metadata for context and the link to access the actual data or details about how to request access.

If you are not sure about the right access level or the licence for your data(set), check the institutional or funder policies or speak to your local research data management support team. Also be sure to choose a data repository that supports your desired access level and licence. You can search for such a data repository on a registry such as Re3data, by filtering on ‘Database access’ and ‘Database licence’. If you are depositing data associated with a publication, it is recommended to include a data availability statement in your publication. This statement communicates to readers of your publication where the data(set) is available and how it can be accessed. It also includes a link to the data(set).

Restricted access refers to data that one can access under certain conditions (e.g. because of commercial, sensitive, or other confidentiality reasons or the data is only accessible via a subscription or a fee). Restricted data may be available to a particular group of users or after permission is granted.

cat_graph:knb.16FF07C8	Justifiable Cost	Determining whether costs to EU or EOSC users is justifiable is not simple: Providers may not be in a position to explain their cost structures, new services may have higher unit costs, and it may be difficult to obtain a representative assessment from all Managers that are in scope.  POSI provides two criteria that can be publicly attested as an alternative:  - “Time-limited funds are used only for time-limited activities. The day to day operations of the infrastructure should be supported by day to day sustainable revenue sources.” This confirms that Manager costs/ fees are not subsidising non-service activities.  - “Mission-consistent revenue generation. The infrastructure revenue should be consistent with the mission.” This confirms that Manager costs/ fees are not subsidising non-PID activities. There are two cases to consider in the tests:  - Publicly available financial statements are reviewed.   - A statement is made if financial records are not public.

cat_graph:knb.F886775D	Resolution Percentage	Published literature indicates that even if a PID is resolvable, the content it resolves to does not always remain meaningful. A randomised, statistically significant sample needs to be evaluated on a periodic basis (annually?) to gauge the efficiency of resolution of services and whether any siugnificant content drift has occurred. For managers, resolvable PIDs include tombstone PIDs.	Published literature indicates that even if a PID is resolvable, the content it resolves to does not always remain meaningful.

cat_graph:knb.ADC20191	Persistence Median	Published literature suggest that the mean time that PIDs remain resolvable (a measure of persistence) varies quite significantly with the service in question. A randomised, statistically significant sample needs to be evaluated on a periodic basis (annually?) to gauge the persistence of services. Managers can assist by publishing such a figure themselves or by publishing a random list of PIDs from time to time for external evaluation.   The value reflects the mean time it takes for persistance to fail for all PIDs issued. As an example, a value of 8.5 means that after 8.5 from being minted, 50% of PIDs fail to resolve.
